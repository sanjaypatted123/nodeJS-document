Core Concepts

* Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building backend applications
* Modules: Use require and module.exports to organize and reuse code
* File System: Read, write, and manage files using the fs module
* Events: Use EventEmitter to handle and emit custom events
* Buffers and Streams: Handle binary data and stream large files efficiently
* HTTP Module: Create basic web servers using Node's built-in http module

NPM and Packages

* npm: Node package manager used to install and manage libraries
* package.json: Holds metadata and lists project dependencies

Express.js

* Express: Popular web framework for handling routes and middleware
* Routing: Define how different URLs are handled
* Middleware: Functions that run before sending a response
* Template Engines: Render dynamic HTML with EJS or Pug

Database

* MongoDB and Mongoose: Store and query data using schemas and models
* Environment Variables: Store secrets in a .env file and load with dotenv

Security

* Authentication: Use sessions or JWTs for user login
* Validation and Protection: Use helmet, cors, and express-validator for security

Advanced Node

* Async Programming: Use async and await for non-blocking code
* Process and OS: Access system info and environment variables
* Child Process: Run other programs or scripts from Node
* Cluster: Use multiple CPU cores to handle more traffic

APIs

* REST API: Build APIs using standard HTTP methods
* Pagination and Filtering: Efficiently handle large sets of data
* Postman: Tool to test and debug APIs

Tooling

* Nodemon: Automatically restarts server when files change
* Logging: Use morgan or winston to log requests and errors

Testing

* Jest or Mocha: Write tests for your functions and routes

Real-Time Apps

* Socket.io: Build real-time features like chat and notifications

Deployment

* Platforms: Deploy on Render, Heroku, or Railway
* PM2: Keep your app running in the background
* CI and CD: Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions

Bonus Topics

* Caching and Rate Limiting: Use Redis and limit requests to improve performance
* CLI Tools: Build command-line applications using commander
* Serverless: Deploy backend functions using Vercel or Netlify
