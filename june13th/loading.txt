loading in Sequelize â€” that usually refers to Eager Loading or Lazy Loading, 
which means how we load associated data (like related records).


What is Loading in Sequelize?
    There are two main types of loading associated data:

Type	        Meaning
Eager Loading	Load related data together in one query using .include
Lazy Loading	Load related data separately, only when needed using methods like .getPosts()


Eager Loading
    In Sequelize, eager loading is mainly done by using the include option on a 
    model finder query (such as findOne, findAll, etc).

    Load everything in one go using .findOne() or .findAll() with include

Lazy Loading
    Load main record first, then manually load relations
    const user = await User.findByPk(1);       // ðŸ‘ˆ Load user only
    const posts = await user.getPosts();       // ðŸ‘ˆ Load posts when needed


| Feature     | Eager Loading               | Lazy Loading               |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Syntax      | `.findOne({ include })`     | `.getPosts()`, etc.        |
| Queries     | 1 (with JOIN)               | 2 (separate)               |
| Performance | Better if you need all data | Better for conditional use |
| Use case    | Always show child data      | Show only when needed      |
