What Are Associations in Sequelize?
In databases, associations define how tables are related to each other. 
In Sequelize, we define associations between models to represent 
relationships like:

| Relationship Type | Example                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| One-to-One        | A user has one profile          |
| One-to-Many       | A user has many posts           |
| Many-to-Many      | Students belong to many courses |


one to one :
What Is One-to-One?
 One record in Table A is linked to exactly one record in Table B.

Example:
A User has one Profile
A Profile belongs to one User

primary table:
| Line                              | Explanation                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `sequelize.define('User', {...})` | Creates a model named **User**      |
| `name: DataTypes.STRING`          | Adds a column `name` of type string |
| `User.hasOne(models.Profile)`     | Says **one User has one Profile**   |
| `associate = models => {}`        | A function that sets relationships  |

foreign table:
| Line                                 | Explanation                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `sequelize.define('Profile', {...})` | Creates a model named **Profile**  |
| `bio: DataTypes.STRING`              | Adds a column `bio` of type string |
| `Profile.belongsTo(models.User)`     | Says **Profile belongs to a User** |


setProfile(profile) → Adds the userId to the Profile table.

include: Profile → Joins and fetches the related Profile with the User.

Final output will show user + bio together.
