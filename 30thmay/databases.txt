What Is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It allows applications to store, retrieve, modify, and delete data efficiently.

üîç Types of Databases
There are many types, but the two most common are:
1. Relational Databases (SQL)
* Structured data in tables (rows and columns).
* Use Structured Query Language (SQL) to query data.
* Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server.
* Good for structured data and complex queries.
2. Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
* Flexible schema (no fixed table structure).
* Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data.
* Examples: MongoDB, Firebase, Cassandra, Redis.
* Great for scalability and flexible data models.

üß† Basic Concepts
1. Table (in SQL) / Collection (in NoSQL)
* Where data is stored.
* Table = SQL; Collection = MongoDB
2. Row / Document
* A single entry in a table or collection.
* Row = SQL; Document = MongoDB
3. Column / Field
* A specific piece of data (like a name, age, etc.)
4. Primary Key
* A unique identifier for each row/document (like id)
