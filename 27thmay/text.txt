Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has 
minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is 
essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to 
the request object (req), the response object (res), and 
the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.



## 🧠 What is Middleware in Express.js? (In Depth)

### 🔹 Definition:

**Middleware** in Express.js refers to any function that has access to:

* The **request object** (`req`)
* The **response object** (`res`)
* The **next middleware function** in the application’s request-response cycle

Its function signature looks like this:

```js
function middleware(req, res, next) {
  // logic here
}
```

> 🔁 Think of middleware as a **step in a conveyor belt**. Each step can modify, check, delay, or stop a package (request) before it reaches the end (the response).

## ⚙️ Internal Mechanism and Flow

When a client sends a request to an Express server:

1. Express starts from the **top** of your middleware stack.
2. Each middleware can:

   * Modify `req` or `res` (e.g. add a property like `req.user`)
   * End the cycle by sending a response (`res.send()` or `res.status().json()`)
   * Pass control to the **next** middleware using `next()`
3. The process continues until:

   * A response is sent, or
   * No middleware is left and no response was sent → this results in a 404.

---

## 🎯 Purpose and Use Cases

Middleware is central to Express. It enables you to:

* **Log requests**
* **Parse JSON or form data**
* **Check user authentication or roles**
* **Sanitize or validate data**
* **Handle CORS headers**
* **Route requests conditionally**
* **Handle errors and send formatted responses**

Without middleware, your Express app would be unstructured and hard to maintain.

## 🔁 Anatomy of a Middleware Function

Here's what a real middleware looks like:

```js
function logger(req, res, next) {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Continue to the next middleware or route
}
```

You use it in your app like this:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(logger); // Apply globally

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Home!');
});
```

### 🔎 What’s happening:

* When someone visits `/`, `logger()` runs first.
* It logs the request, then calls `next()`.
* Only after `next()` is called does the request continue to the route handler.

---

## ⚠️ Key Rules to Remember

1. **Middleware order matters** – Express runs them in the order you define them.
2. **Always call `next()`** unless you're ending the request with `res.send()` or `res.end()`.
3. **Never call `next()` after sending a response** – it will throw an error.

---

## 🚫 Example of Bad Middleware (Common Mistake)

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Blocked here');
  next(); // ❌ This should NOT be called after res.send
});
```

This will throw an error: “Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client.”

---

## 🔐 Real-Life Example: Authentication Middleware

```js
function isAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.headers.authorization === 'Bearer mysecrettoken') {
    next(); // Authenticated
  } else {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
}

app.use('/dashboard', isAuthenticated);
app.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to your dashboard');
});
```

Here, only authenticated requests can access `/dashboard`.

---

## ✅ Summary (In Depth)

* Middleware is **core logic** between receiving a request and sending a response.
* Each middleware has access to `req`, `res`, and `next()`.
* You can use middleware for logging, validation, parsing, authentication, error handling, and more.
* Middleware is **modular and composable**, enabling reusable and clean code.
* Express executes middleware in a **linear pipeline**, and the chain continues until a middleware ends the request or no middleware is left.

An Express application can use the following types of middleware:

        Application-level middleware
        Router-level middleware
        Error-handling middleware
        Built-in middleware
        Third-party middleware

## 🔹 Middleware in Express.js

### ✅ What is Middleware?

In Express.js, **middleware** functions are functions that have access to the **request (`req`)**, **response (`res`)**, and the **next middleware** in the application’s request-response cycle. Middleware can modify the request or response objects, end the request, or call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware.

```js
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Request received');
  next(); // Passes control to the next function
}
```

---

## 🔸 Request Pipeline

### 🔁 How Middleware Works in the Request Pipeline

The **request pipeline** in Express is a chain of middleware functions executed **in order**, from top to bottom, for every incoming request. Each middleware can inspect, modify, or end the request. If a middleware doesn’t call `next()`, the pipeline stops and no further middleware or route handler runs.

🔗 The flow:

1. Request enters Express app
2. Passes through global middleware (`app.use`)
3. Hits route-specific middleware (if any)
4. Reaches route handler (`app.get`, `app.post`, etc.)
5. Response is sent, optionally passing through response-modifying middleware

```js
app.use(middleware1);   // Global middleware
app.use(middleware2);

app.get('/user', middleware3, (req, res) => {
  res.send('User Page');
});
```

Here, a GET request to `/user` goes through `middleware1`, `middleware2`, `middleware3`, then the route handler.

## 🔸 Types of Middleware

Express supports different types of middleware depending on what they do and where they are applied:

---

### 1. **Application-Level Middleware**

These are attached directly to the Express app using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()`.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('App-level middleware');
  next();
});
```

📌 Used for logging, request parsing, authentication, etc.

---

### 2. **Router-Level Middleware**

These are bound to an instance of `express.Router()` and used to modularize middleware for specific routes or groups.

```js
const router = require('express').Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Router-level middleware');
  next();
});

router.get('/dashboard', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Dashboard');
});

app.use('/admin', router);
```

📌 Helps organize code in large applications.

---

### 3. **Built-in Middleware**

Express provides built-in middleware like:

* `express.json()` – parses incoming JSON requests
* `express.urlencoded()` – parses URL-encoded data

```js
app.use(express.json());
```

📌 Essential for handling POST/PUT data.

---

### 4. **Third-Party Middleware**

Installed via npm and integrated with `app.use()`. Examples:

* `morgan` for logging
* `cors` for handling Cross-Origin requests
* `helmet` for security headers

```js
const morgan = require('morgan');
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```

📌 Saves time and follows best practices.

---

### 5. **Error-Handling Middleware**

Has **four parameters**: `(err, req, res, next)`. Used to catch and respond to errors thrown in earlier middleware or routes.

```js
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});
```

📌 Placed **after all other middleware** to catch errors.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Application-level | Applied globally or to specific routes      | `app.use()`                      |

| Built-in          | Included in Express (e.g. `express.json()`) | `app.use(express.json())`        |
| Third-party       | External packages (e.g. `morgan`, `cors`)   | `app.use(morgan('dev'))`         |
| Error-handling    | Catches and handles errors                  | `app.use((err, req, res, next))` |
